## Abstract
The Fayette County Public Schools is working with local and district
law enforcement and student support services to investigate the
influence of violent crime in the community on student outcomes. We want
to estimate the radius of the buffer around the location of a violent
crime at which there is a detectable effect on student outcomes, with an
emphasis on attendance. We also are interested in estimating any
cumulative effects (both within and between school years) to understand
more about concentration effects.
